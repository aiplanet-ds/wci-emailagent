# Changelog: LLM-Powered Price Change Detection

## Version 2.0 - LLM Detection Implementation

**Date**: 2024-03-15

### Summary
Replaced keyword-based price change detection with LLM-powered semantic detection using Azure OpenAI GPT-4. This provides more accurate, context-aware detection with confidence scoring.

### 2. Modified Files

#### `services/delta_service.py` 🔄 MODIFIED
**Changes**:
- **Removed**: Keyword-based `is_price_change_email()` method (lines 116-191)
- **Added**: New LLM-powered `is_price_change_email()` method
  - Now accepts `user_email` parameter
  - Fetches full email content with attachments
  - Calls `llm_is_price_change_email()` from llm_detector
  - Returns detection result dict with confidence and reasoning

- **Updated**: `process_user_messages()` method
  - Uses new detection result structure
  - Logs confidence scores and reasoning
  - Displays detection results to user
  - Only processes emails meeting confidence threshold

**Before**:
```python
if self.is_price_change_email(message):
    logger.info(f"   ✅ PRICE CHANGE DETECTED")
```

**After**:
```python
detection_result = self.is_price_change_email(user_email, message)
if detection_result.get("meets_threshold", False):
    confidence = detection_result.get("confidence", 0.0)
    reasoning = detection_result.get("reasoning", "N/A")
    logger.info(f"   ✅ PRICE CHANGE DETECTED (Confidence: {confidence:.2f})")
    logger.info(f"   💡 Reasoning: {reasoning}")
```

#### `services/extractor.py` 🔄 MODIFIED
**Changes**:
- **Removed**: Keyword-based `is_price_change_email()` function (lines 87-123)
  - Removed all keyword lists
  - Removed regex pattern matching
  - Removed validation logic from extraction

- **Updated**: `extract_price_change_json()` function
  - Removed detection check (now assumes pre-validated by LLM detector)
  - Updated docstring to reflect new workflow
  - Focuses solely on data extraction

**Before**:
```python
def extract_price_change_json(content: str, metadata: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    try:
        # Check if this is actually a price change email
        if not is_price_change_email(content, metadata):
            return {"error": "Email does not appear to be a price change notification"}
```

**After**:
```python
def extract_price_change_json(content: str, metadata: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Extract structured data from price change email using Azure OpenAI.

    Note: This function assumes the email has already been validated as a price change
    notification by the LLM detector service. It focuses solely on data extraction.
    """
    try:
```

#### `main.py` 🔄 MODIFIED
**Changes**:
- **Updated**: Comment in `process_user_message()` function
  - Clarifies that email is pre-validated by LLM detector
  - Removed check for detection error

**Before**:
```python
result = extract_price_change_json(combined_content, email_metadata)

# Check if email was identified as price change
if result.get("error") == "Email does not appear to be a price change notification":
    print("   ℹ️  Not a price change email - SKIPPED")
    return
```

**After**:
```python
# Note: Email has already been validated as price change by LLM detector in delta_service
# This extraction focuses solely on extracting structured data
result = extract_price_change_json(combined_content, email_metadata)
```

#### `.env.template` 🔄 MODIFIED
**Changes**:
- **Added**: New configuration section for LLM detection

```bash
# LLM Price Change Detection Configuration
# Confidence threshold for price change detection (0.0 - 1.0)
# Higher values = more strict detection, fewer false positives
# Lower values = more lenient detection, may include borderline cases
# Recommended: 0.75 (balanced) | 0.85 (strict) | 0.65 (lenient)
PRICE_CHANGE_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD=0.75
```

## Workflow Changes

### Before: Two-Stage Keyword Detection
```
Email arrives
  ↓
[Stage 1: Broad keyword filter in delta_service.py]
  ↓ (if matches)
[Stage 2: Precise keyword validation in extractor.py]
  ↓ (if confirmed)
[Stage 3: LLM extraction of data]
  ↓
Processed email
```

### After: LLM Detection → LLM Extraction
```
Email arrives
  ↓
[LLM Detection with confidence scoring]
  ↓ (if confidence >= threshold)
[Vendor Verification]
  ↓ (if verified)
[LLM Extraction of data]
  ↓
Processed email
```

- **Reasoning provided** for each decision
- Easy to debug and understand

### 3. Maintainability ✅
- **No keyword lists** to maintain
- **Separation of concerns** (detection vs extraction)
- Clear, modular code structure

### 4. Flexibility ✅
- **Configurable threshold** via environment variable
- Adapts to various writing styles and languages
- Handles informal and formal communications

### 5. Testing ✅
- Comprehensive test suite included

## Breaking Changes

### None! 🎉

The changes are **backward compatible**:
- Same external API for email processing
- No changes to database schema
- No changes to UI or frontend
- Existing configuration still works

**Only new requirement**: Add `PRICE_CHANGE_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD` to your `.env` file (optional, defaults to 0.75)

---

## Migration Guide

### For Existing Installations

1. **Update code** (already done if you pulled latest changes)

2. **Update `.env` file**:
   ```bash
   # Add this line to your .env file
   PRICE_CHANGE_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD=0.75
   ```

3. **Test the new detection**:
   ```bash
   python test_llm_detection.py
   ```

4. **Monitor logs** during initial rollout:
   - Watch confidence scores
   - Review detection reasoning
   - Adjust threshold if needed

5. **No restart required** - changes take effect immediately

---

## Configuration

### Confidence Threshold

Choose based on your needs:

| Threshold | Description | Use Case |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| **0.65** | Lenient | High recall, catch all possible price changes |
| **0.75** | Balanced (default) | Good precision and recall |
| **0.85** | Strict | High precision, only obvious price changes |
| **0.90** | Very strict | Minimize false positives |

### Azure OpenAI Settings

Ensure these are configured in your `.env`:
```bash
AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key
AZURE_OPENAI_API_ENDPOINT=https://your-resource.openai.azure.com/
AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=gpt-4.1
AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION=2024-12-01-preview
```

---

## Testing

### Automated Testing
```bash
# Run full test suite
python test_llm_detection.py
# Select option 1
```

Expected output:
- 6 test scenarios
- Accuracy report
- Confidence statistics
- Detailed reasoning for each test

### Manual Testing
```bash
# Test custom email
python test_llm_detection.py
# Select option 2
# Enter your email details
```

---

## Monitoring

### What to Watch

1. **Detection Logs**:
   ```
   ✅ PRICE CHANGE DETECTED (Confidence: 0.92)
   💡 Reasoning: Email from supplier announcing new pricing effective April 1st
   ```

2. **Confidence Scores**:
   - Average confidence over time
   - Low confidence detections (< 0.80)
   - High confidence rejections (> 0.90)

3. **False Positives/Negatives**:
   - Emails incorrectly marked as price changes
   - Missed price change notifications

### Adjusting Performance

If you see:
- **Too many false positives**: Increase threshold (e.g., 0.85)
- **Missing price changes**: Decrease threshold (e.g., 0.65)
- **Inconsistent results**: Check API status, review reasoning

---

## Cost Impact

### API Usage
- **Old system**: ~0 API calls for detection (keyword-based)
- **New system**: 1 API call per email for detection

### Cost Estimate
- ~500 tokens per detection
- GPT-4: ~$0.01 per detection (varies by region)
- 100 emails/day = ~$1/day
- Reduced false positives save extraction costs

### ROI
- Higher accuracy = fewer manual reviews
- Better data quality = less rework
- Time savings > API costs

---

## Support

### Troubleshooting

**Problem**: Detection not working
- Check Azure OpenAI credentials
- Verify API endpoint is correct
- Run test suite to validate setup

**Problem**: Low accuracy
- Review detection logs and reasoning
- Adjust confidence threshold
- Check for API errors

**Problem**: High costs
- Increase confidence threshold
- Monitor email volume
- Consider filtering obvious non-matches first

### Getting Help

1. Check logs for error messages
2. Run test suite: `python test_llm_detection.py`
3. Review documentation: `docs/llm_detection.md`
4. Report issues with example emails

## Future Roadmap

Planned enhancements:
- [ ] Caching for duplicate email detection
- [ ] Batch API calls for multiple emails
- [ ] User feedback loop for threshold tuning
- [ ] Detection analytics dashboard
- [ ] Multi-language support optimization

---

## Summary

This update replaces rigid keyword-based detection with intelligent LLM-powered analysis, providing:
- ✅ Higher accuracy and fewer false positives
- ✅ Context-aware semantic understanding
- ✅ Confidence scoring and transparency
- ✅ No keyword maintenance required
- ✅ Easy testing and validation
