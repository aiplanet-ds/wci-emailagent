# üîß Testing Login Fix

## What I Changed:

1. **Added debug logging** to token cache operations:
   - Shows when cache is loaded
   - Shows when cache is saved
   - Shows token acquisition attempts
   - Shows account matching

2. **Fixed cache saving** - now always saves, not just when `has_state_changed`

3. **Better error handling** with try/catch blocks

---

## How to Test:

### **Step 1: Stop the current server**
Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where `python start.py` is running

### **Step 2: Delete old cache files (if any)**
```bash
Remove-Item token_cache_*.json -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
```

### **Step 3: Start the server**
```bash
python start.py
```

### **Step 4: Watch the terminal output**

When you login, you should see:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è No existing cache file for your_email@example.com
‚úÖ Token exchange successful for your_email@example.com
   Cache file should be at: token_cache_your_email_at_example_dot_com.json
‚úÖ Saved token cache for your_email@example.com to token_cache_your_email_at_example_dot_com.json
‚úÖ Added user your_email@example.com to delta monitoring
```

### **Step 5: Go to dashboard**

After login, when you go to `/dashboard`, you should see:
```
‚úÖ Loaded token cache for your_email@example.com from token_cache_your_email_at_example_dot_com.json
üîç Checking token for your_email@example.com, found 1 accounts
   Account: your_email@example.com
‚úÖ Found matching account for your_email@example.com
‚úÖ Successfully got token for your_email@example.com
```

### **Step 6: Refresh the page**

If you refresh `/dashboard`, you should see the same output - **NOT** "session expired"

---

## What to Look For:

### ‚úÖ **Good Signs:**
- Cache file is created: `token_cache_*.json`
- "Successfully got token" messages
- Dashboard loads without errors
- Can refresh page without re-login

### ‚ùå **Bad Signs:**
- "No cache file" after login
- "No matching account found"
- "Token acquisition failed"
- "session expired" error

---

## If It Still Fails:

**Share the terminal output** from the login process, especially:
1. The lines after you click "Sign in with Microsoft"
2. The lines when you're redirected back to the app
3. The lines when dashboard loads
4. Any error messages

This will help me identify exactly where the token storage is failing.

## Expected Files After Login:

```
email-agent/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ token_cache_your_email_at_domain_dot_com.json  ‚Üê Should be created
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ start.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .env
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

---

**Ready to test!** Start the server and try logging in. Watch the terminal output carefully.
